# Problem 1

I installed the package palmerpenguins.

## Describe the penguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The variables in the penguins dataset include species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year.

The penguins dataset contains 8 columns and 344 rows.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

## Scatterplot

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

## Create the data frame

``` r
library(tidyverse)
df_p2 = tibble(
  random_value = rnorm(n=10, mean=0, sd=1),
  value_positive = random_value>0,
  char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  factor = factor(c("level1", "level2","level3", "level1", "level2", 
                    "level3","level1", "level2", "level3", "level1"))
  )
```

## Obtain the mean of the variables

``` r
mean(pull(df_p2,random_value))
```

    ## [1] 0.3865689

``` r
mean(pull(df_p2,value_positive))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(df_p2,char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_p2, char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_p2,factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_p2, factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can only obtain the mean for logical and numeric variables. For
character and factor variables, we cannot obtain their mean and R return
NA.

## Convert to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_p2,value_positive))
as.numeric(pull(df_p2,char))
as.numeric(pull(df_p2,factor))
```

The logical variable is converted into 0 and 1 since it is binary. Thus
we can obtain the mean for the variable.

The transformation of the character variables return NA. Character
variable cannot be convereted into numeric values since their values
does not represent a number. In this case, we cannot obtain the mean of
the character variable since the numeric calculation cannot be performed
on those values.

The factor variable has been converted into numbers that represent the
factor labels representing the levels within the factor, which is
meaningless. Thus the mean returned based on those numeric values is
also meaningless.
